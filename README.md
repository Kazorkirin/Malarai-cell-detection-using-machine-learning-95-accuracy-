# Malarai-cell-detection-using-machine-learning-95-accuracy-

This is one of my project i did at my uni.Really had a great time figuring out on how to do this and also exploring lot of machine learning algo and thier accuracies,this project has a lot of graphs and comparisions between various models and my model
The Improved CNN model for malaria detection is very promising, with a test accuracy of 95.08%. This is better than VGG16 and InceptionV3 models. The model uses multiple convolutional layers, batch normalization, and dropout layers, which help it learn well and avoid overfitting. However, there are areas for improvement. Hyperparameter tuning was only done once, so trying more settings could make the model even better. Adding more features to the dataset could help it distinguish malaria from other diseases, improving diagnostic accuracy. Increasing the depth of the network by adding more layers could also help it learn complex patterns. Despite its high accuracy, the model's F1 score of around 0.5 shows it needs to balance precision and recall better, as it still has issues with false positives. These improvements could make the model more reliable for the real world

Conclusion

This project successfully developed an improved CNN model for malaria detection, which performed comparably to state-of-the-art models like VGG16, ResNet50, and InceptionV3. The use of deep learning models for automated malaria diagnosis shows great potential in improving the speed and accuracy of detection, ultimately ,it has better disease management and treatment. Future work could involve further tuning of hyperparameters, exploring other advanced architectures,More layers and validating the models on larger and more diverse datasets.
